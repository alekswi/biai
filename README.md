# **INFO**
Database used in the project was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shadikfaysal/fruit-and-vegetables-ssm). There was a need to prepare the dataset before training, as there were different formats than .jpg, images of different dimensions, and channels size.â€‹
<p>After some training it turned out that the test and validation set were the same so some changes were needed.
